I collect here some general remarks about this teaching experience. 

## Organisation

All sessions are the shadow of discussions with Johanna and Jonathan. Together we went a lot in circles. There never was actual homework. We did everything together. But over the time I tried to organise these write-ups a bit more.

Nevertheless, I try to not put much more in a write-up than we had in the session. A typical session lasts between 1 and 2 hours, but we are not trying to be efficient. In a more disciplined classroom style setting I would expect a session to not last longer than 50min and if the participants spend time working on their own doing homework, one could probably combine two sessions into one. 

The write-ups distinguish Exercises and Activities. Activities are not something I would expect high-school students to do on their own. Activities reflect the discussions I had with Johanna and Jonathan.  Exercises I often added later and should be suitable for self-study.

## Takeaways

Every lesson has some takeaways. The takeaways try to answer the question of how mathematicians approach an open problem. How do you launch yourself into an investigation? What are the methods of mathematical investigation? 

These are questions that are not asked at school. And even at university students often spend more time with "frozen" mathematics rather than doing research of their own.

I don't think it has to be this way ... at least that is what I am exploring here ... if you want to join in let me know, I could use more feedback ...

But if you just want to do the fun maths and ignore the takeaways, outlooks and philosophical questions, that is a very honorable attitude towards mathematics. I think all mathematicians would agree that to do maths is more fun than to philosophize about it.

## Programmming

I think it is wrong to teach maths without teaching programming. We all learn to use calculators at school. This was an innovation of the 20th century. Now it is 2020 and it is time to move on. 

When I went to school, computers where mysterious things and only the nerdiest amongst us dared to approach it. Not even me. I remember that during the school breaks (this was in the early 1980ies) I would sometimes go to the computer room and cast an admiring look at the pioneers writing the first computer games, mostly versions of [space invaders](https://elgoog.im/space-invaders/). And then go on to play soccer with my mates.

But now, in 2020, to learn to write some small programs is not more difficult than to learn how to use a calculator. Partly, this is due to having programming languages like Python designed for being easier to learn. Moreover, any question you may have on how to program something already has an answer that is just a google search away, more often than not on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python).

More interestingly, once you learned to use and write the easy programs, you are just one step away from advanced programming concepts such as recursion and the difference of call-by-value and call-by-name and call-by-reference. So this can be really a spring board to learning programming seriously.
