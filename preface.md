I collect here some general remarks about this teaching experience. 

## Takeaways

Every lesson has some takeaways. The takeaways try to answer the question of how mathematicians approach an open problem. How do you launch yourself into an investigation? What are the methods of mathematical investigation? 

These are questions that are not asked at school. And even at university students often spend more time with "frozen" mathematics rather than doing research of their own.

I don't think it has to be this way ... at least that is what I am exploring here ... if you want to join in let me know, I could use more feedback ...

But if you just want to do the fun maths and ignore the takeaways, outlooks and philosophical questions, that is a very honorable attitude towards mathematics. I think all mathematicians would agree that to do maths is more fun than to philosophize about it.

## Programmming

I think it is wrong to teach maths without teaching programming. We all learn to use calculators at school. This was an innovation of the 20th century. Now it is 2020 and we moved on. When I went to school, computers where mysterious things and only the nerdiest amongst us dared to approach it. Not even me. I remember that during the school breaks (this was in the learly 1980ies) I would sometimes go to the computer room and cast an admiring look at the pioneers writing the first computer games, mostly versions of [space invaders](https://elgoog.im/space-invaders/) and then go on to play soccer with my mates.

But now, in 2020, to learn to write some small programs is not more difficult than to learn how to use a calculator.

More interestingly, once you learned to use and write the easy programs, you are just one step away from advanced programming concepts such as recursion and the difference of call-by-value and call-by-name and call-by-reference. So this can be really a spring board to learning programming seriously.
