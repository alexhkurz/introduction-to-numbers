At the end of the course students will 

- be able to  do modular arithmetic
- understand the mathematical definition of the real numbers
- have practiced mathematical proofs
- ...

**Prerequisites:** Roughly speaking GCSE mathematics.

## Chapter 1: Modular Arithmetic

Every lesson has some takeaways. The takeaways try to answer the question of how mathematicians approach an open problem. How do you launch yourself into an investigation? What are the general principles of mathematical investigation? Even though modular arithmetic is well understood, if you approach it with an open minded inquiry based approach, you find already the same methods at play as in much more advanced cutting edge mathematics.
