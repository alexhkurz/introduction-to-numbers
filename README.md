# Introduction to Numbers

Not a course, rather a blog keeping track of teaching this material to my children (age 15 and 18)  ... teaching is maybe not the right word, rather I want to make them discover the maths for themselves.

**Prerequisites:** Roughly speaking GCSE mathematics. Know how to play sudoku.
