# Introduction to Number Theory

Not a course, rather a blog keeping track of teaching this material to my children ... teaching is maybe not the right word, rather I want to make them discover the maths for themselves.

**Prerequisites:** Roughly speaking GCSE mathematics. Know how to play sudoku.

Every lesson has some takeaways. The takeaways try to answer the question of how mathematicians approach an open problem. How do you launch yourself into an investigation? What are the methods of mathematical investigation? 

Even though modular arithmetic is well understood, if you approach it with an open minded inquiry based approach, you find already the same methods at play as in much more advanced cutting edge mathematics.
